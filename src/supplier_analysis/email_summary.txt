**Demand Analysis**
- 3-month forecast: April 2025 - 110 units, May 2025 - 110 units, June 2025 - 110 units.
- Key demand drivers include consistent monthly requirements.
- Inventory optimization recommendations suggest maintaining a minimum safety stock of 21 units, while an optimal reorder quantity should be set at 100 units.
